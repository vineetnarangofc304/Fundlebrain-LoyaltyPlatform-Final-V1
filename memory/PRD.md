# PRD — KAZO Fundle Platform

## Original problem statement
Build a complete enterprise-grade standalone loyalty, CRM, analytics, campaign automation, customer intelligence, support, reporting and API-monitoring platform for KAZO (kazo.com — premium Indian women's fashion brand), powered by Fundle. Dedicated single-tenant deployment.

## User-locked design constraints
- ✅ LIGHT editorial theme only (NO dark themes)
- ✅ REAL-TIME live MongoDB aggregations (NO stored snapshots, NO cron precompute)
- ✅ Emergent LLM Key (GPT-5.2 / Claude Sonnet 4.5) for AI narratives
- ✅ ZERO dummies / hardcode / fallbacks — real data or N/A
- ✅ Build dashboards one-by-one, full drilldown, test after each before moving on

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor MongoDB + JWT/cookie auth + Emergent LLM
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + shadcn primitives + Recharts + Cormorant Garamond + Manrope
- MongoDB DB: `kazo_fundle_db` (single tenant)
- All routes prefixed `/api`

## Roles (10)
Super Admin · Brand Admin · CRM Manager · Marketing Manager · Regional Manager · Store Manager · Store Staff · Support Agent · Analytics Viewer · Read-only Executive

## Sidebar sections
- **DASHBOARDS** — Command Center *(new)*, Sales, Customer Analytics, Loyalty, Campaign Performance, Store Performance, NPS & Feedback
- **CUSTOMERS** — Customer 360
- **MARKETING** — Campaigns, Coupons
- **AI TOOLS** — Fundle Brain
- **OPERATIONS** — Stores, Item Master, API Monitor
- **SUPPORT** — Tickets, NPS Inbox
- **REPORTS** — Reports & Exports
- **CONFIGURATION** — Loyalty Rules, Public Site CMS
- **ADMINISTRATION** (admin only) — User Management

## What's been implemented

### Iteration 1 (Jan 2026)
- Auth (JWT + portal gating), 10-role RBAC, audit logging
- Executive Cockpit (24+ KPIs), Customer 360, Loyalty Configurator
- Coupon Engine (13 types), Campaign Manager, Fundle Brain AI (real Mongo function-calling)
- Live API Monitor (5s refresh), POS endpoints, NPS, Tickets, Reports (CSV exports)
- 3 login portals (Enterprise / Store / CRM), Store Ops portal
- Public website (13 SEO pages)
- Seeded: 1504 customers, 8003 transactions, 26 stores, 8 coupons, 9 campaigns, 400 API logs, 300 NPS, 30 tickets

### Iteration 2 (Jan 2026) — ✅ 83/83 backend tests passing
- 9-section sidebar, 6 dashboards (Sales/Customer/Loyalty/Campaign/Store/NPS), Item & Store Master, CMS, Coupon edit, Ticket detail, Transaction drilldown

### Iteration 3 (May 2026) — ✅ Foundation for FundleBrain Dashboards
- ✅ **Universal Drilldown** — `POST /api/dashboard/drilldown` + `/csv` with collection whitelist, role-aware store scoping (security-hardened), `_id` & `password_hash` scrubbed, 200-row paginated, 10k CSV cap
- ✅ **AI Intelligence Report** — `POST /api/dashboard/insight` returns structured `{headline, summary, drivers[], recommendations[]}`. 1-hour in-memory cache, regenerate-on-force; uses Emergent LLM (GPT-5.2). Frontend renders a full multi-section editorial report panel.
- ✅ **Command Center Dashboard** — Replaces Executive Cockpit as `/admin` index. 12 live KPIs, sparkline area chart, cohort distribution bar chart (Today / 1–7d / 8–30d / 31–90d / 90d+), live alerts, 30s auto-refresh
- ✅ **City + Store global filters** on Command Center — every KPI, sparkline, cohort, alert, drilldown, and AI report re-computes live for the chosen scope
- ✅ **Active customers** now computed from ground-truth transactions (`distinct customer_id` in window) instead of stale `last_visit_at`
- ✅ **Reusable `DrillDownModal.jsx` + `AIInsightStrip.jsx`** components for every upcoming dashboard
- ✅ **Security fix** — `_store_scope` now denies (403) when store-bound role has no `store_id`; startup migration backfills `store_id` for `store.mumbai@kazo.com` and `staff.delhi@kazo.com`
- ✅ Iteration 3 testing: 30/31 pytest pass, 1 P0 fixed (store-scope bypass)

### Iteration 5 (May 2026) — ✅ FundleBrain Phase 3B + colour upgrade (5 dashboards)
- ✅ **Cohorts & Segmentation** — `GET /api/dashboard/cohorts-segmentation`: one-timer revenue-at-risk panel with 15%-recovery estimate + recency buckets, frequency bands (One-timer/Light/Regular/Loyal/VIP) with ATV, spend bands, tier donut, retention triangle (12×12 cohort heatmap, signup-month × month-offset), acquisition trend. Verified: bands mutually exclusive (sum = transacted), offset-0 = 100%.
- ✅ **Points Economics v2** — `GET /api/dashboard/points-economics`: earn-vs-burn gauge with gradient bar, outstanding liability, 12-month earn/burn stacked flow, breakage risk (180d stale), top redeemers leaderboard.
- ✅ **Campaign ROI v2** — `GET /api/dashboard/campaign-roi`: Sent→Delivered→Opened→Clicked→Converted funnel, channel pie + table, campaign leaderboard sorted by ROI with red/green colour coding.
- ✅ **Executive Summary v2** — `GET /api/dashboard/executive-summary` + `/pdf`: composite snapshot + ReportLab branded PDF download (KAZO burgundy header, light cream cards, indigo/teal section bars). Valid `%PDF` payload.
- ✅ **Formula Catalog** — `GET /api/dashboard/formula-catalog`: 23 KPI formulas across 8 categories (Revenue/Customer/RFM/Cohort/Loyalty/Campaign/Experience/Operations) auto-rendered with search + category pills. Single source of truth.
- ✅ **Command Center colour upgrade** — alerts now coloured (rose=CRITICAL with gradient, amber=WARNING with gradient + left accent strip), sparkline shows Net ₹ (burgundy) + Txns (indigo) as overlapping area charts with custom gradients.
- ✅ **Cohorts dashboard** AI Cohort & Segment Intelligence Report on top.
- ✅ Iteration 5 testing: 11/11 backend pytest + 5/5 frontend Playwright (`/app/test_reports/iteration_5.json`). No P0/P1 issues.

### Iteration 4 (May 2026) — ✅ FundleBrain Phase 3A complete (3 new dashboards + colour system)
- ✅ **Customer 360 v2** — `GET /api/dashboard/customer-360/{id}`: live RFM score + 11-segment label, lifetime aggregates from raw transactions, monthly spend chart (area + bar overlay), store affinity, category affinity, recent transactions, points ledger, NPS history, AI Customer Intelligence Report
- ✅ **Store Performance v2** — `GET /api/dashboard/store-performance-v2`: Leaderboard (ranked, vs-prev delta with NEW fallback), By City (multi-coloured bars + scorecard), Day Analysis (weekday bar + 7×24 heatmap). store_manager/store_staff scoped to own store.
- ✅ **RFM & Churn Dashboard** — `GET /api/dashboard/rfm`: live 5×5 RFM heatmap (health-coded), 11 named segment cards (clickable → drilldown), 3 churn buckets, quintile cutoffs panel, 6 KPI tiles
- ✅ **Brand colour system** — accent palette CSS vars (indigo/teal/amber/rose/slate/emerald + burgundy/champagne). `KPICard` accepts `accent` prop (left strip + soft gradient). Shared `SectionHeading` + `CHART_PALETTE`.
- ✅ **AI Intelligence Report** rolled out on all 3 new dashboards (cached 1hr per payload)
- ✅ Iteration 4 testing: 22/22 backend pytest pass + 100% frontend flows verified (`/app/test_reports/iteration_4.json`)

## Test credentials
See `/app/memory/test_credentials.md` — Brand Admin: `admin@kazo.com / Kazo@2026`

## Known production hardening pending
- AI insight cache is in-memory (single worker only) — fine for preview, move to Redis for prod
- Drilldown CSV uses single-chunk StreamingResponse — fine at 10k cap, chunk for true streaming later
